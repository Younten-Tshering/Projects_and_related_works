Ideally, you should all have a real hostname for your system, pointing to your CSIM server, by the end of the semester. At the end of the semester, you should also be ready to place your site at a more permanent home. Please include a plan for how you will do this. Note that AIT, CSIM, or AIT SU could probably be pursuaded to host some of your groups’ sites. Others would be more appropriately hosted offsite.</div>
